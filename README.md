# FiiiCoin

A versatile, scalable and energy efficient blockchain technology

## Abstract

FiiiCoin is a transaction network specifically designed for mobile devices mining purpose only. The blockchain technology enable all mobile devices participate in maintaining the blockchain network while leaving it idle and charging battery instead of relying on expensive and powerful computer hardware running 24/7 to do the mining work. The main objective is to create a least effort way and promote re-using the existing available resources (mobile devices) together to take part in maintaining the blockchain. Even the non-IT people or non-crypto fans can easily learn and involve in mining as long as they at least have a smartphone.

In fact, smartphone or any other mobile devices are not suitable to be setup as a blockchain node. The reasons are the computing power is weak, storage capacity is limited to keep a full blockchain and battery powered device are not meant to be 24/7 running all time, and it requires high network bandwidth to synchronize blocks data. If the mobile device runs the node using 4G network, it will finish up all the bandwidth in no time.

FiiiCoin is built using an enhanced version of Proof-of-Capacity consensus algorithm – Delegated Proof-of-Capacity (DPoC) to achieve the mobile mining capability while keeping the mobile device from being a full node and perform extensive block synchronization work. FiiiCoin is developed using an in-house built customizable blockchain technology - FiiiChain. FiiiChain provide standard blockchain modules with the “plug-and-play” capability for developers to modify the blockchain characteristic base on the given business requirement.
